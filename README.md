Basic iOS application to implement traffic lights using Natural Language Processing.

or green (like traffic lights). 

The user can enter phrases in the text field i.e. natural language. phrases can be:-

RED :- red, stop, crimson , please stop, i am telling you to go red, time to stop, etc.
YELLOW:- yellow,sun ,slow down , please slow down, time to slow down,i am telling you to slow down,etc.
